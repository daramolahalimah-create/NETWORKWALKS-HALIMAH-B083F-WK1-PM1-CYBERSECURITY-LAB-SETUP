## 📌 Project Overview

This project documents the setup of a virtual cybersecurity laboratory using virtualBox and Kali Linux for learning and practicing penetration testing techniques in a controlled environment.

---


## 🎯 Objectives
- Set up a virtual machine using VirtualBox.
- Install and import configure Kali Linux.
- Create a private NAT Network for the lab.
- Configure network connectivity for Kali Linux.
- Assign a consistent IP address to the Kali VM.
- Verify network connectivity and DNS resolution.
- Take a clean VM snapshot for recovery.
- Document the complete setup process.
  
---

## 🛡️ Purpose of the Lab
For the following activities; 
- Network reconnaissance
- Port scanning
- Vulnerability assessment
- Packet analysis
- Web security testing
- Exploitation practice
- Security-tool experimentation
  
⚠️ **Important:** This laboratory must only be used for systems that you own or have explicit permission to test. Do not use the lab or its tools to attack unauthorized systems

# 🪜 Lab Setup Procedure

## Step 1. Install 7-Zip

7-Zip was installed to extract the Kali Linux virtual-machine package, which may be distributed as a `.7z` archive.

**Tool:** 7-Zip

---

## Step 2. Install VirtualBox

VirtualBox was installed as the hypervisor.

---

## Step 3. Create the NAT Network

A dedicated NAT Network was created in VirtualBox.

Configuration:
Network Name: NatNetwork
IPv4 Prefix:  10.0.0.0/24
DHCP:         Enabled
IPv6:         Disabled

A **NAT Network** was selected because multiple virtual machines connected to the same NAT Network can communicate with one another while also having outbound network connectivity.

This will allow future attacker and target VMs to communicate within the lab.


---

## Step 4. Import Kali Linux

The Kali Linux virtual machine was downloaded from the official Kali Linux website and imported into VirtualBox.

The VM network adapter was configured as follows:

```text
Adapter 1
Attached to: NAT Network
Network:     NatNetwork
Adapter Type: Intel PRO/1000 MT Desktop
```

The VM was allocated:

```text
RAM: 2048 MB
```
<img width="1920" height="891" alt="Screenshot_2026-09-28_10_28_15" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0aa4e1ce-c9db-4e6b-ad48-294c88f20d89" />

A shared folder was also configured for transferring required files between the host operating system and the Kali VM.



---

## Step 5. Configure the Kali Linux Network

The Kali Linux network configuration was checked and configured with a consistent IPv4 address.

Example configuration:

```text
IP Address: 10.0.0.2
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Gateway: 10.0.0.1
DNS: 8.8.8.8
```

A consistent IP address makes it easier to document the lab and reference the Kali machine in future exercises.

---

## Step 6. Create a Clean VM Snapshot

After completing the initial configuration, a VirtualBox snapshot was created.

Example snapshot name:

```text
Clean Kali - Network Setup
```

The snapshot represents the clean baseline of the laboratory.

If a future exercise changes or damages the VM configuration, the machine can be restored to this baseline.

| 🌍 Test Internet connectivity | `ping 8.8.8.8`                  | Successful replies              |
| 🔎 Test DNS resolution        | `nslookup networkwalks.com`     | Domain resolves                 |
| 🧰 Verify Nmap                | `nmap --version`                | Nmap version displayed          |
| 🔄 Verify snapshot            | Restore snapshot and run `ip a` | Baseline configuration restored |

### Example Results

```text
IP Address:
10.0.0.2/24

Gateway:
10.0.0.1

DNS:
8.8.8.8
```

# 🐞 Problems Encountered & Solutions

## Problem 1. Internet Connectivity After Static IP Configuration

After manually configuring the IPv4 settings, Internet connectivity failed. 

The workaround i used during this lab was:

```bash
sudo nmcli connection modify "Wired connection 1" ipv4.dad-timeout 0
```

The network connection was then restarted/rebooted and connectivity was tested again.

# 💡 What I Learned
Through this project, i gained practical experience with;

- Virtual environment setup
- VirtualBox configuration and NAT Network creation
- kali configuration and IPv4 addressing, subnet masks, gateaways, and DNS settings
- clean VM snapshot creations 
- Documentation
